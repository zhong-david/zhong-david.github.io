# Introduction

Hi! Welcome to my (incomplete) EECS 370 notes page!

This webpage will provide notes on introductory computer architecture. More specifically, topics that are covered in the University of Michigan's EECS 370 (Introduction to Computer Organization). I will do my best to put as much of the course content within this notebook, but this notes page is NOT meant to be a replacement for the full course. Please refer to the course webpage [here](https://eecs370.github.io/). 

My main motivation is to provide insights into each topic and provide context/motivation on why it is important. This notebook was developed in December 2023 following the F23 semester, so please note that some of the course-specific material may be outdated (such as the ISA used, projects, etc.).
